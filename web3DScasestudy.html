	<h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>
	As the UI Lead for Threshold Network, one of my design goals was to effectively scale our product design work. For the <a href="https://dashboard.threshold.network/">Threshold financial dashboard</a>, we needed a design system. Since there weren't existing web3 design systems, we built our own, hosted it on Storybook, and open sourced it to Github.

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started by researching the available open source design systems and compiling notes in Coda on the top 10 systems. I found that there were no robust Web3 solutions. The team needed a system that had a Figma community file, flexible code, well-maintained documentation, and an open source usage license.</p> 
	<p>After some debate, we landed on Chakra as the best solution for both design and engineering. I revised and rebranded the Community file for Chakra's design system to be for a financial Web3 dashboard. Myself and Sasha worked together to periodically tend system updates as the Threshold dashboard grew in complexity.</p>
    <p>We faced some challenges initially with Chakra's dark mode and light mode when we started adding our own custom brand colors, and it did take some upfront engineering time for troubleshooting.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>After maintaining the system through several feature launches, I had a robust resource for the UX/UI community in the Web3 space. So, I packaged up the system and published it to GitHub. My goal was to provide a design resource for internal teams across the Thesis studio working on other Web3 projects, as well as outside design teams that could also benefit from our design research.</p>
