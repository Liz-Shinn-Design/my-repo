	<p><span class="label">Summary</span><br>
	As the UI Lead for Threshold Network, one of my design goals was to effectively scale our product design work. Myself and the UX Lead researched several different design system solutions, and ultimately settled on building our own and then open sourcing it.</p>

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started by researching the available open source design systems and compiling notes in Coda. I found that the DS offerings for a Web3 product were slim and not advanced enough for our dashboard's use case. The team needed a system that had a Figma community file, flexible code, well-maintained documentation, and an open source usage license.</p> 
	<p>We landed on Chakra as the best solution. I revised and rebranded the initial Chakra offerings to be for a financial Web3 dashboard. Myself and the UX Lead worked together to tend system updates as the dashboard grew in complexity.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>After maintaining the system through several feature launches, I had a robust resource for the UX/UI community in the Web3 space. So, I packaged up the system and published it to GitHub. My goal was to provide a design resource for internal teams across the Thesis studio working on other Web3 projects, as well as outside design teams that could also benefit from our design research.</p>
