	<h1>Open Sourcing a Web3 Design System</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://threshold.network/">Threshold</a></h3>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>I was brought on as UI Lead to contribute to the web3 financial dashboard for Threshold Network, a studio project of Thesis. One of my design goals as UI Lead was to scale our product design work by using efficient systems. Myself and the UX Lead researched several different design system solutions, and ultimately settled on building our own and then open sourcing it.</p>
	<h4>My Approach</h4>
	<p>We started by researching the available open source design systems and compiling our notes in Coda. I found that the DS offerings for a web3 product were slim and not advanced enough for our dashboard's use case. We sought a system that had a Figma community file, flexible enough code, well-maintained documentation, and an open source usage license. We landed on Chakra as the best solution, and I built out the Figma file throughout production of the MVP dashboard. Myself and the rest of the design team tended the DS with updates as the dashboard grew in complexity.</p>
	<h4>Open Sourcing</h4>
	<p>After maintaining the system through several feature launches, we had a robust resource for the UX/UI community in the Web3 space. So, I packaged up the system and published it to GitHub. My goal was to provide a design resource for internal teams across the Thesis studio working on other Web3 projects, as well as outside design teams that could also benefit from our design research.</p>
