    <h3>Summary</h3>
	<h3 style="color: #C92C46;">I led UI Design for Threshold Network. I built and tended a complex Web3 design system for the Threshold financial dashboard, coordinated with a cross-functional team to host it on Storybook, and open sourced it to Github for the Web3 community.</h3>

	<h3>The Key Problem</h3>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Product features were bespoke and lacked visual consistency</h4>
        <p>Without a central design system to coordinate design efforts, Threshold product solutions quickly deviated from consistent application. Introducing a design system and maintaining it as a team helped to streamline the design process.</p>
        </div>
</div>

		
<div class ="row">
	<div class="column-article">
	<h3>Early Thinking</h3>
	<p>I started by researching the available open source design systems and compiling notes in Coda on the top 10 systems. I found that there were no robust Web3 solutions.</p> 
    <p>The team needed a system that had a Figma community file, flexible code, well-maintained documentation, and an open source usage license. We decided to use Chakra, and to adopt an atomic Design System structure.</p>
    <p>I organized our file and documentation into Theme elements (color, typography, grids, etc) and Component elements (atoms, molecules, organisms, etc.).</p>

<h3>The Challenges</h3>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Engineering and Design prioritized different things in an open source Design System</h4> 
        <p>The engineering team wanted robust code docs, positive reviews from other engineers, and flexibility in customization. The design team prioritized visual maturity, active maintenance, and a robust existing Figma resource. After some debate, we landed on Chakra as the best solution for both design and engineering.</p>
        </div>

       <div class= "quote">
       <h4>Design System maintenance takes time, so it's best if it's a team priority</h4>
       <p>As we introduced new features, we periodically needed to tend the design system. Sasha and I settled on a sprint schedule to coordinate updates to the system as new things were introduced and pinged each other for review in Figma.</p>
        </div>
</div>

<div class ="row">
	<div class="column-article">
	<h3>The Results</h3>
    <p>I revised and rebranded the Chakra Community file to work for Threshold. Myself and Sasha worked together to periodically tend system updates as the Threshold financial dashboard grew in complexity.</p>
	<p>After maintaining the system through several feature launches, I had a robust resource for the UX/UI community in the Web3 space. So, I packaged up the system and published it to GitHub. My goal was to provide a design resource for internal teams across the Thesis studio working on other Web3 projects, as well as outside design teams that could also benefit from our design research.</p>
