<h2>The key problems</h2>
    <div class="quote">
        <h4>Unfamiliar terminology</h4>
        <p>I included a Glossary and user documentation to make sure that our dashboard was accessible to as broad of an audience as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <h4>Overwhelming interfaces with too much data</h4>
        <p>To avoid cognitive overload, I chunked relevant information into sections and abstracted away info that didn't help the user accomplish key tasks like staking and depositing.</p>

<h2>Design challenges</h2>
    <div class="quote">
    <h4>Design team of one</h4>
        <p>I embraced wearing many hats at Keep. I worked on the marketing website, the product documentation, as well as the product design for the web app. Since I had time constraints, I built out a skeleton component library for Keep product work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
        <h4>Web3 UX is challenging</h4>
        <p>The user experience for web3 tools is still developing. Interactions that are common to every web3 dashboard are foreign to the majority of users (e.g. using and connecting a crypto wallet to a protocol).</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class ="row">
	<div class="column-article">
	<h2>Working with the community</h2>
        <p>In the Web3 ecosystem, a <b>DAO</b> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on Discord.</p>
        <p>I saw the opportunity to leverage our community to help me build out the Keep design system. How would we handle feedback, accountability, and sourcing the right people from our community? I ran an ideation workshop to generate ideas.</p> 
	    <p>I wrote a project brief and submitted it to our Discord, and was lucky to find several design volunteers.</p>
        <p>At the end of the project, we had a full-fledged design system that was also a useful blueprint to other studio projects at Thesis (the parent company of Keep).</p>
