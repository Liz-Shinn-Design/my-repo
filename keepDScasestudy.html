	<h5>Summary</h5>
	<p>
        In the Web3 ecosystem, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on Discord. I led a project to build out a Keep DS coordinating with designers in the Keep DAO.

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I started first by facilitating an ideation workshop with the Keep design team. We brainstormed what we needed, what we thought there was expertise for, and what timeframe would be required.</p> 
        <p>I hadn't yet worked with the Keep DAO design community on a project, so this was new territory, with a lot of open questions. How would we handle feedback and accountability? How would we source talent that had the right expertise?</p> 
	    <p>We determined that we get the best results by taking the time to prepare clear project parameters and expectations. Michael and I voted on the top three ideas, and I prepared detailed project briefs for those three prompts.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>The Community Lead Will Rhodes launched the "Playing for Keeps" social campaign along with our design prompts.</p> 
    <p>Several designers from the DAO community volunteered to take on the design system project brief. I led the project over the course of several months with frequent feedback and collaboration. We had a component library internally at the start of the project, and by the end we had a full Keep design system.</p>
    <p>This resource was a helpful blueprint for future design systems across the Thesis studio.</p>
