	<p><span class="label">Summary</span><br>
	In the Web3 ecosystem, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on Discord. The Community Lead ran a UGC (User Generated Content) campaign called "Playing for Keeps," and I jumped at the opportunity to find and work with designers in the Keep DAO.</p>

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started first by facilitating a workshop with the design team to determine what design needs could best be met by collaborating with the DAO Community. We quickly realized the best results would come from clear direction, so we selected three ideas that were high leverage and I prepared project briefs for these three prompts.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>We released these to the community. The most successful of the three ideas was the Community created Keep Design System. Myself and a team of designers created a new design system for the product, and maintained it.</p>
