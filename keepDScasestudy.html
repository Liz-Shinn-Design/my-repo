	<h3>Early Thinking</h3>
        <p>In the Web3 ecosystem, a <b>DAO</b> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on Discord.</p>
        <p>I started first by facilitating an ideation workshop with the Keep design team. We brainstormed what we needed, what we thought there was expertise for, and what timeframe would be required.</p> 
	    <p>In order to get the best results, I wanted to take the time to prepare clear project parameters and expectations. Michael and I voted on the top three ideas from our brainstorm, and I prepared detailed project briefs for those three prompts.</p>

<h2>The Challenges</h2>
    <div class="quote">
        <h4>There weren't yet established guidelines for DAO collaboration.</h4>
        <p>How would we handle feedback, accountability, and sourcing the right talent? For design, I was successful by writing project briefs, pinging back and forth in Figma, and hanging out in the Keep Discord regularly.
    <div class="quote">
        <h4>Community contributors were often in different time zones or working other hours.</h4>
        <p>Initially, I spent a substantial amount of time campaigning in the Keep DAO Discord talking to design contributors in the community. As the project continued, I reshuffled my availability and dialed back my presence to maintain a better cadence with other work.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>The Community Lead Will Rhodes launched the "Playing for Keeps" social campaign along with our design prompts.</p> 
    <p>Several designers from the DAO community volunteered to take on the design system project brief. I led the project over the course of several months with frequent feedback and collaboration. I had built a Keep component library internally at the start of the project, and by the end we had a fully built out Keep design system.</p>
    <p>This resource was a helpful blueprint for future design systems across the Thesis studio, and a best practice template for sourcing expertise from a project DAO.</p>
