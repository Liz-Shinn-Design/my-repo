                        Working closely with engineering to understand the problem space, I redesigned the product's
                        information architecture and abstracted away items that didn't help the user accomplish key
                        tasks like staking and depositing.

                <p>
                    With the launch of the new
                    <a href="https://dashboard.keep.network/overview">Keep financial dashboard</a>, I worked together
                    with an outside engineering agency to relaunch the Keep marketing website. I brought life into the
                    site's landing page by using transitional animation with custom photo illustration to explain the
                    key benefits of decentralization and why Keep's technology was important for asset security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I extended our existing icon library and designed new icons for the site that leaned into the
                    medieval theme of Keep's brand, such as a scroll and quill to represent documentation.

                        I embraced wearing many hats at Keep! I designed the marketing website, collaborated with
                        engineering to write the product's user documentation, and designed the web app. Since I had
                        time constraints, I built out a skeleton component library for Keep product work.

                    <p>
                        Mental models and the user experience for web3 tools are still evolving. Interactions that are
                        common to every web3 dashboard are foreign to the majority of users (for example, using and
                        connecting a crypto wallet to a protocol).

                    <h2>Working with the community</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the Web3 ecosystem, a <b>DAO</b> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose
                        organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on
                        Discord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I saw the opportunity to leverage our community to help me build out the Keep design system. How
                        would we handle feedback, accountability, and sourcing the right people from our community? I
                        ran an ideation workshop to generate ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote a project brief and submitted it to our Discord, and was lucky to find several design
                        volunteers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the project, we had a full-fledged design system that was also a useful blueprint
                        to other studio projects at Thesis (the parent company of Keep).
