	<p><span class="label">Summary</span><br>
	In the Web3 ecosystem, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a loose organization of fans and users of a crypto protocol that congregate on a platform, usually on Discord. The Community Lead ran a UGC (User Generated Content) campaign called "Playing for Keeps," and I jumped at the opportunity to find and work with designers in the Keep DAO.</p>

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started first by facilitating a ideation workshop with the design team to determine what we needed, what we thought there was expertise for, and what timeframe would be required. We hadn't yet worked with the design community, so this was new territory.</p> 
	<p>We quickly realized the best results would come from clear directions. We voted on the top three ideas, and I prepared project briefs for these three prompts.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>The most successful of the three was the Design System, since we had just a skeleton DS internally at the start of the project. Several designers from the DAO community elected to take on this Design System, and I led the project over the course of several months to build it out. This resource became very helpful as a blueprint for future design systems across the Thesis studio.</p>
