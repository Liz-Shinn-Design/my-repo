                <p>
                    I worked with Thesis on the Keep product to design a financial dashboard and website that empowered users to
                    learn more about crypto.

                        Working closely with engineering to understand the problem space, I redesigned the product's
                        information architecture and abstracted away items that didn't help the user accomplish key
                        tasks like staking and depositing.

                <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    With the launch of the new
                    <a href="https://dashboard.keep.network/overview">Keep financial dashboard</a>, I worked together
                    with an outside engineering agency to relaunch the Keep marketing website. I brought life into the
                    site's landing page by using transitional animation with custom photo illustration to explain the
                    key benefits of decentralization and why Keep's technology was important for asset security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I extended our existing icon library and designed new icons for the site that leaned into the
                    medieval theme of Keep's brand, such as a scroll and quill to represent documentation.

                    <h4>Design team of one</h4>
                    <p>
                        I embraced the startup mentality of all hands on deck. I designed the marketing website, collaborated with
                        engineering to write the product's user documentation, and designed the web app. Since I had
                        time constraints, I built out a skeleton component library for Keep product work.

                    <h4>Web3 is challenging for new users</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mental models and the user experience for web3 tools are still evolving. Interactions that are
                        common to every web3 dashboard are foreign to the majority of users (for example, using and
                        connecting a crypto wallet to a protocol).

                    <h3>The Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        I facilitated a collaborative project with Keep's web3 community to build out the rest of the Keep design system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the project, we had a full-fledged design system. It helped us to create consistent designs and was a useful blueprint
                        to other studio projects at Thesis (the parent company of Keep).
