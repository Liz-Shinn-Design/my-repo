	<h3>Case Study 1<br>
	Client: <a href="https://embody.space/">Embody</a><br>
	#ProductDesign, #UserResearch</h3>
	<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>Overview</b></p>
	<p>Embody is the first privacy-forward cycle awareness app. I was the lead product designer. I was hired to research the user pain points of existing period trackers, and design an app that reflected what users actually want in their period tracking experience. I’m obsessed with the mission of the Embody app, and I was very excited to tackle this app.</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>Approach</b></p>
	<p>At the very beginning, to help guide the team I started with a workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. In the workshop, the team and myself wrote down all of the potential tasks a user might want to accomplish using the Embody app on sticky notes. We turned these insights into a key features list for our MVP product. For prioritization, I made recommendations based on my experience using period trackers, a design audit of the period app landscape, and findings from a qualitative user study I conducted with 10 of our user base. We continued to reflect back on this list of features as our guiding light for deciding feature development through the launch of the app.</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>Design Process</b></p>
	<p>Next, let me walk you through an example of my design process for a particular feature. When I created the app’s symptom tracking feature, I started first with a user flow. Using this decision tree I could easily iterate on the copy. I then drafted an early wireframe that we tested internally with a Figma prototype. In that first draft, we discovered that users wanted to quickly log symptoms since they’re doing it daily. They wanted simplicity over complexity of choice. I used these findings to then revise the feature to be a quick, larger button selection using icon imagery, instead of text-heavy symptoms in a long list that you must read each one.</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 48px;"><b>Implementation</b></p>
	<p>As a small team, I wore many hats. In addition to designing the product, I also designed the marketing materials for the app store, and some social media work when needed. Another example of a project I worked on was designing the Embody website. It was important for Embody’s brand and business goals that we stood out from your typical generic stock photography. I contracted a brand photographer, and I directed a photo shoot where we snapped shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios. It gave us an edge in the space, and the photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
