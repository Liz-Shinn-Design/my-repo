	<h1>Figma for Non-Designers Workshop</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://thesis.co/">Thesis</a></h3>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>While working as a UI Designer for Threshold (a studio project of Thesis), I noticed a frequently occurring comment of my colleagues that they wanted to better understand Figma. To help to expand the capabilities of my cross-functional team, I built and ran several workshops internally on the basics of Figma for non-designers.</p>
	<h4>My Approach</h4>
	<p>I started by researching the current resources available. I found that YouTube tutorials, Figma documentation, and Figma Community files were largely geared towards a professional design audience. They were too complex for a non-design audience and assumed a lot of existing design knowledge. For my workshop, I simplified the material to the essential workflows my colleagues needed and turned it into a workshop format. After running 5 workshops internally, I found a small group of no more than 3 people at 1 hour in length was the most successful.</p>
	<h4>The Results</h4>
	<p>After seeing success internally, I wanted to provide the latest version of the workshop to a larger group of folks who may experience this same problem at their organizations. I published the workshop to Figma Community with an intro of how to run the workshop; it's been downloaded 700+ times and viewed 2,000+ times.
