                <p>
                    I worked with Thesis to create and lead several voluntary team workshops on Figma basics to foster my team's
                    professional development.

                    <li>
                        <span class="circle">1</span> Design team members were frequently pulled in to make minor changes to Figma
                        files or for editing slide templates, leading to distractions and delays for other design work.

                    <li>
                        <span class="circle">2</span> Non-design team members needed to wait on the availability of a designer to make these minor changes, causing a bottle neck effect.

                        tutorials, Figma Help docs, and Figma Community files were geared towards professional designers.

                        I empowered the team by streamlining the material into a workshop with the essential workflows my
                        colleagues needed. I ran several 1-hour Zoom workshops on these Figma basics.

                    <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        I hosted the workshop as a live session inside of Figma, to make sure that we were solving getting Edit access to Figma and getting their hands on the tool from the outset. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most available Figma tutorials required a heavy time investment and were too complex for non-designer workflow needs. What my teammates really needed was guidance for these common questions: how do I export a file, how do I edit text, what are artboards, and troubleshooting help. For each section, I led a hands-on exercise so participants actually used the particular interface section we were talking through. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After running the workshop a few times, I found that keeping it to around 2-3 team members was the most effective structure that allowed enough room for specific questions, and that 1 hour was the best amount of time (30 minutes was too short).

                <h3>The Impact</h3>
                <p>I received positive feedback from participants who both enjoyed the live learning session and said that they now felt less overwhelmed by Figma afer the workshop.</p>
                <p>
                    I published the workshop file to Figma Community along with workshop documentation. To date, it's
                    been downloaded 1,000+ times and viewed 3,000+ times.
