	<h1>Figma for Non-Designers Workshop</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://thesis.co/">Thesis</a></h3>
	<p><b>Overview</b><br>
	While working as a UI Designer for Threshold (a studio project of Thesis), I noticed a frequently occurring comment of my colleagues that they wanted to better understand Figma. To help to expand the capabilities of my cross-functional team, I built and ran several workshops internally on the basics of Figma for non-designers.</p>
	<p><b>My Approach</b><br>
	I started first by examining existing resources. I learned that YouTube tutorials, Figma documentation, and Figma Community resources were largely geared towards a professional design audience. They were too complex, and assumed a lot of existing design knowledge. I stripped these down to their bones and simplified the material into a workshop format. I found that a smaller group of no more than 3 colleagues was the most successful for about 1 hour. I ran a small pilot workshop internally, and then continued to iterate on the workshop after each session.</p>
	<p><b>The Results</b><br>
	After running 5 successful workshops internally, I wanted to provide these results to a larger group of folks who may experience this same problem at their organizations. I published the workshop to Figma Community with an intro of how to run the workshop; it's been downloaded 750+ times and viewed 2,000+ times!
