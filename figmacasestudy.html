	<h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>	
        During my time as a designer at Thesis, my non-designer colleagues often commented that they wanted to improve their Figma skills, but they didn't know where to start. Since I'm well-versed in Figma, I built and ran several workshops internally on the basics.

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started by researching the current resources available. I found that YouTube tutorials, Figma documentation, and Figma Community files were largely geared towards a professional design audience. They were too complex and assumed a lot of existing knowledge.</p> 
	<p>To fix this, I simplified the material to the essential workflows my colleagues needed and turned it into a remote workshop, facilitated via Zoom. After running several workshops internally, I found that a small group of no more than 3 people at 1 hour in length was the most successful.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
        <p>After seeing success internally, I wanted to provide the workshop to a larger group of folks who may experience this same problem at their organizations. I published the file to Figma Community along with workshop documentation; it's been downloaded 700+ times and viewed 2,000+ times!</p>
