	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>During my time as a designer at Thesis, Figma was one of our core tools. Often my non-designer colleagues commented they wanted to improve their Figma skills, but they didn't know where to start. Since I'm well-versed in Figma, I built and ran several workshops internally on the basics for a non-design audience.</p>
	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>I started by researching the current resources available. I found that YouTube tutorials, Figma documentation, and Figma Community files were largely geared towards a professional design audience. They were too complex for a non-design audience and assumed a lot of existing design knowledge. For my workshop, I simplified the material to the essential workflows my colleagues needed and turned it into a workshop format. After running 5 workshops internally, I found a small group of no more than 3 people at 1 hour in length was the most successful.</p>
	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>After seeing success internally, I wanted to provide the latest version of the workshop to a larger group of folks who may experience this same problem at their organizations. I published the workshop to Figma Community with an intro of how to run the workshop; it's been downloaded 700+ times and viewed 2,000+ times.
	<p>You can find the tutorial Community file <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1199724949260413441/figma-basic-tutorial-workshop">here</a> in Figma.</p>
