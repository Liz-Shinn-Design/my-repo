	As Product Design Lead for the Embody app, I designed and launched a privacy-forward period tracking app that empowered women and menstruators to live in sync with their cycles.</p>

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>To start, I facilitated a team workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. We wrote down all of the potential tasks a user might want to accomplish using the Embody app. We combined this list with user surveys to build a list of key features for our MVP product.</p>
	<p>In my research, I examined common user flows and patterns of leading period apps like Clue, Drip, and Flo. Additionally, I conducted a qualitative user study with 8 of our core users. This study underscored the necessity of defining jargon such as "cycle syncing" and "luteal phase," and it guided the focus of our initial feature set toward addressing what users found lacking in their existing period trackers: improved data privacy, insightful symptom analysis, cycle explanation tips, and cycle-based planning.</p>

	<h3>My Design Process</h3>
	<p>For Embody product work, I first mapped out core user flows to then build wireframes and prototypes. For example, when building Embody's symptom logging feature, I created Figma prototypes for early testing. I discovered several issues and made improvements to the app design using test findings.
	<p>To leverage Figma components and collaborate with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system in Figma. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>

	<h3>Website Work</h3>
	<p>For Embody’s business goals, it was crucial that the Embody website stood out from the sea of generic stock photography. I hired a brand photographer and directed a photo shoot capturing shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios. This approach gave us an edge in the space, and the photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
