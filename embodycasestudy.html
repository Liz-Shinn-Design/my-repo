	<h1>Embody Cycle Tracking App</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://embody.space/">Embody</a></h3>
	<p><b>Overview</b><br>
	I was hired as the Product Design Lead for the Embody app to design and bring to market a privacy-forward period tracking app that helped women and menstruators to live in sync with their cycles.</p>	
	<p><b>My Approach</b><br>
	I started the team off with a workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. The project founder and myself wrote down all of the potential tasks a user might want to accomplish using the Embody app. We combined this list with user surveys to build a list of key features for our MVP product. I reviewed typical user flows of leading period apps like Clue, Drip, and Flo to see what our users valued and what they were missing. I also led a qualitative user study with 8 of our core users. Some of the findings I learned were that we should be careful to define jargon ("Cycle syncing," "luteal phase") and that we should focus our initial feature set on what users lacked in their existing period trackers (data privacy, helpful analysis of symptoms logged, explainer tips about their cycle, and planning their life in harmony with their cycle).</p>	
	<p><b>My Design Process</b><br>
	In my design process, I start with a user flow and then use wireframes. For example, when building Embody's symptom logging feature, I used a simple Figma wireframe prototype to test early on. I learned that users prioritize speed and usability over customization. I revised our approach to use larger buttons that made logging a breeze for users and custom symptom icon imagery for friendliness and easy scanning.
	<p><b>Leveraging Design Systems</b><br>
	To leverage Figma components and be able to work quickly with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>
	<p><b>Website Work</b><br>
	When I did an audit of existing websites in the space, I saw that it was important for Embody’s brand and business goals that we stood out from your typical generic stock photography. I contracted a brand photographer, and I directed a photo shoot where we snapped shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios. It gave us an edge in the space, and the photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
