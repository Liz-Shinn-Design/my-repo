                <h2>Creating the MVP Embody app</h2>
                <p>
                    During the discovery phase of the project, I conducted a competitive audit and a qualitative user
                    study. The goal of the study was to understand what users want from a period tracking app. I learned
                    that users wanted:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>more data privacy, especially after the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision</li>
                    <li>insightful symptom analysis</li>
                    <li>cycle explanation tips</li>
                    <li>cycle-based planning (exercise, food, etc)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After the study concluded and I presented the findings to the team, I facilitated a team workshop
                    using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. In the workshop, we used post-it notes to write down all the
                    features that we (as period tracker users ourselves) wanted to see in our app. We cross-referenced
                    this with my competitive audit and user research to create a list of the highest priority features
                    to include for the MVP launch.

                <h2>Launching the Embody widget</h2>
                <p>
                    Embody had a WhatsApp thread where I regularly shared in-progress design work with the early Embody
                    community. From this, I received feedback that users wanted a quick way to see where they were in
                    their cycle. To address this, I worked closely with the lead engineer to create an Embody widget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal was to educate users while keeping the widget experience enjoyable. Since the menstrual
                    cycle can be stressful, any Embody app experiences should feel reassuring in both content and visual
                    design. We used a seasons metaphor to visually reflect the four phases of the cycle. For the widget,
                    I incorporated seasonal imagery so users could easily see which phase they were in right from their
                    home screen. They could also view their upcoming period date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We received positive feedback from users who really appreciated the convenience of the Embody
                    widget. At the time, no other period trackers offered a widget, making it a key differentiator for
                    Embody.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>My strategy for new features</h2>
                <p>
                    For any new features, in the discovery phase I referenced past research and floated early design
                    work to users in our community. Using this and team feedback, I first mapped out the user flow to
                    understand the full journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created wireframes and Figma prototypes so we could test early. Embody's symptom logging feature
                    was key to the app experience, so I prioritized this feature for early user testing. I discovered
                    several issues and made improvements to the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also built a design system in Figma to better collaborate with the lead engineer and document
                    design decisions. The design system allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added new
                    features and new team members.

                    <h2>Marketing the app</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to our social presences on TikTok and Instagram, I considered many entry points in
                        the user journey for how someone would hear about Embody.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important first impression was the Embody website. In a sea of generic stock photos, we
                        wanted Embody to show its authenticity. I directed a photo shoot to capture shots of Embody
                        users using our app in real-world scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        We used the photography and the user feedback we gathered during the photo shoot across our
                        socials, pitch decks, app store listings, and the website.
