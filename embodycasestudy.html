	<h2>Why do we need the Embody app?</h2>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Other trackers sold sensitive customer data</h4> 
        <p>Embody encrypts and stores everything locally on the customer's device to protect sensitive data and gives true control to users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Other trackers lack useful cycle insights</h4> 
        <p>Embody uses your log to give you useful insights (e.g. is it every cycle on Day 10 that I feel a surge of energy?)</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Other trackers are full of ads and paywalls</h4>
        <p>Embody's core mission is to provide menstrual wellness education tools, and cycle explanations are accessible to all.</p>

    <h2>Research findings</h2>  
    <p>I validated our assumptions regarding the product market fit with a study. I interviewed 8 of our core users, and this study showed that our users thought their existing period trackers lacked:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>data privacy, especially after the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision</li> 
        <li>insightful symptom analysis</li>
        <li>cycle explanation tips</li>
        <li>cycle-based planning (exercise, food, etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also facilitated a team workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework.</p>
    <p>We used this research to build a list of key features for our MVP product.</p>

    <h2>Embody on the go</h2>
    <p>I also found in my research that users wanted to be able to view their current cycle status quickly.</p>
    <p>We launched an Embody widget so that users can easily see from their phone's home screen what part of their cycle they're in.</p>

	<h2>My design approach</h2>
    <p>For key features, I first mapped out the user flow to understand the full user journey. I then built wireframes and prototypes.</p>
    <p>I created Figma prototypes for early testing of Embody's symptom logging feature since it's vital to the app experience. I discovered several issues and made improvements to the design.</p>
	<p>I built an Embody design system in Figma to better collaborate with the lead engineer and document my design decisions. The design system allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added new product features.</p>

	<h2>Bringing Embody to market</h2>
    <p>I considered many entry points in the user journey for how someone would first learn about the Embody app.</p>
    <p>An important first impression was the Embody website. In a sea of generic stock photos, we wanted Embody to show its authenticity. To achieve this goal, I contracted and managed a photo shoot to capture shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios.<p> 
    <p>We were able to use the user feedback and photography we got during the photo shoot across our socials, pitch decks, app store listings, and the website.</p>
