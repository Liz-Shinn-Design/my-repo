	<h3>The Problem</h3>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Trackers don't prioritize data privacy.</h4> 
        <p>In the past few years, Clue and Flo both were in the news for selling customer data.</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Trackers lack personalized insights</h4> 
        <p>Recording a symptom repeatedly produced no insights (e.g., is it every cycle on Day 10 that you have a headache?)</p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Trackers have a clunky tone & experience</h4>
        <p>Users are tired of period app notifications and recommendations that were judgy or condescending.</p>

    <h3>Early Thinking</h3>  
    <p>In the first month of product work, I ran a qualitative user study with 8 of our target users. This study guided the focus of our initial feature set toward addressing what users found lacking in their existing period trackers: improved data privacy, insightful symptom analysis, cycle explanation tips, and cycle-based planning.</p>
    <p>I also facilitated a team workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. We used the results of this brainstorm to build a list of key features for our MVP product.</p>
	<p>I referenced common user flows and patterns from leading period apps like Clue, Drip, and Flo.</p>

	<h3>My Design Process</h3>
	<p>For key features, I first mapped out core user flows to then build wireframes and prototypes. Embody's symptom logging feature was vital to the app experience, so I created Figma prototypes for early testing. I discovered several issues and made improvements to the app design using test findings.
	<p>To leverage Figma components and collaborate with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system in Figma. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>

	<h3>Marketing Embody</h3>
	<p>In order to differentiate Embody from the sea of generic stock photography, I hired a brand photographer. I directed a photo shoot capturing shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios.<p> 
    <p>This approach won us new fans, as the models from the photo shoot also were excited about the Embody app. The photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
