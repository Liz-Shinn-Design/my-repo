	<h1>Embody Cycle Tracking App</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://embody.space/">Embody</a></h3>
	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>I was hired as the Product Design Lead for the Embody app to design and bring to market a privacy-forward period tracking app that helped women and menstruators to live in sync with their cycles.</p>	
	<h4>My Approach</h4>
	<p>I started the team off with a workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. We wrote down all of the potential tasks a user might want to accomplish using the Embody app. We combined this list with user surveys to build a list of key features for our MVP product.</p>
	<p>In my research, I looked at commmon user flows and patterns of leading period apps like Clue, Drip, and Flo to see what our users valued and what they were missing. I also led a qualitative user study with 8 of our core users. The study highlighted the need to define jargon ("Cycle syncing," "luteal phase") and helped inform the focus of our initial feature set on what users lacked in their existing period trackers (better data privacy, helpful analysis of symptoms, cycle explainer tips, and planning with their cycle).</p>	
	<h4>My Design Process</h4>
	<p>For Embody product work, I started with a user flow and then used wireframes. For example, when building Embody's symptom logging feature, I used a simple Figma wireframe prototype to test early on. I learned that users prioritized logging speed over customization. I revised our approach to use larger buttons and custom symptom icons for user friendliness and easy scanning. We saw improvements in usability and positive feedback from users with these changes.
	<h4>Leveraging Design Systems</h4>
	<p>To leverage Figma components and collaborate with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system in Figma. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>
	<h4>Website Work</h4>
	<p>After I did a design audit of other websites in the space, I saw it was important for Embody’s brand and business goals that we stood out from the sea of generic stock photography. I contracted a brand photographer, and I directed a photo shoot where we snapped shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios. It gave us an edge in the space, and the photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
