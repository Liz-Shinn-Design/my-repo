	<h3>The Key Problems</h3>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Data privacy should be a top priority</h4> 
        <p>Nearly a third of women in the United States use a period tracker. Clue and Flo sold sensitive customer data to advertising agencies and betrayed their users trust. Embody stores everything locally on your own phone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Trackers lack personalized insights</h4> 
        <p>Trackers don't use logged data effectively and don't show patterns about your cycle (e.g., is it every cycle on Day 10 that I experience a surge of energy?)</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Trackers have a clunky tone & experience</h4>
        <p>Period apps are plagued by a lack of relevancy in their cycle info, and a user experience that's full of ads and paywalls.</p>
        </div>
        <div class= "quote">
        <h4>Leadership in femtech is male-dominated</h4> 
        <p>The Embody product leadership team is all women. We brought unique insights and intuition from our own experiences to our solution, and it was one that we all used.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="column-article">
    <h3>Early Thinking</h3>  
    <p>Early on in product scoping, I ran a qualitative user study with 8 of our target users.</p> 
    <p>This study helped us focus our initial feature set. It showed that our users thought their existing period trackers lacked: <li>data privacy, especially after the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision</li> 
    <li>insightful symptom analysis</li>
    <li>cycle explanation tips</li>
    <li>cycle-based planning (exercise, food, etc)</li>
    </p>
    <p>I also facilitated a team workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. We used the results of this brainstorm to build a list of key features for our MVP product.</p>
	<p>I referenced common user flows and patterns from leading period apps like Clue, Drip, and Flo.</p>

	<h3>My Design Process</h3>
	<p>For key features, I first mapped out core user flows to then build wireframes and prototypes. Embody's symptom logging feature was vital to the app experience, so I created Figma prototypes for early testing. I discovered several issues and made improvements to the app design using test findings.
	<p>To leverage Figma components and collaborate with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system in Figma. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>

	<h3>Marketing Embody</h3>
	<p>In order to differentiate Embody from the sea of generic stock photography, I hired a brand photographer. I directed a photo shoot capturing shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios.<p> 
    <p>This approach won us new fans, as the models from the photo shoot also were excited about the Embody app. The photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
