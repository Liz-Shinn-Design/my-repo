	<h1>Embody Cycle Tracking App</h1>
	<h3>Client: <a href="https://embody.space/">Embody</a></h3>
	<p><b>Overview</b><br>
	I was hired as the Product Design Lead for the Embody app to build a privacy-forward period tracking app that reflected what users actually want in their period tracking experience — to get helpful analysis, explainer tips about their cycle, and feel more in control.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>	
	<p><b>Approach</b><br>
	At the outset, I started the team off with a workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework. In this workshop, the team and myself wrote down all of the potential tasks a user might want to accomplish using the Embody app. With this list, we built a set of key features for our MVP product. I used my experience tracking my own cycle as well as a design audit of leading period apps Clue and Flo. To supplement, I conducted a qualitative user study with 8 of our users that helped us to better make decisions about our product.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>	
	<p><b>Design Process</b><br>
	As one example, I initiated the design process for building the app’s symptom logger with a user flow. I tested internally with a Figma wireframe prototype, and I discovered that users prioritized quickly logging symptoms. I used these findings to simplify with larger button selections, and custom icon imagery addressed the need for simplicity versus a text list of symptoms.
<div class="spacer"></div>
	<p><b>Design Systems</b><br>
	To leverage Figma components and be able to work quickly with the lead engineer, I built an Embody design system. This allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added product features.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
	<p><b>Website Work</b><br>
	When I did an audit of existing websites in the space, I saw that it was important for Embody’s brand and business goals that we stood out from your typical generic stock photography. I contracted a brand photographer, and I directed a photo shoot where we snapped shots of Embody users using our app in real-world scenarios. It gave us an edge in the space, and the photos performed well in Embody pitch decks and on our social channels.</p>
