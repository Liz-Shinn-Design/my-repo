                        Embody encrypts and stores everything locally on the customer's device to protect sensitive data
                        and gives true control to users.

                    <p>
                        Embody uses your log to give you useful insights (for example, is it every cycle on Day 10 that
                        I feel a surge of energy?)

                    <p>
                        I conducted qualitative user research to understand Embody's product market fit. Period tracker
                        users thought their chosen trackers lacked:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>data privacy, especially after the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision</li>
                        <li>insightful symptom analysis</li>
                        <li>cycle explanation tips</li>
                        <li>cycle-based planning (exercise, food, etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With the study findings, I facilitated a team workshop using the “Jobs to be Done” framework.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a result, we built a list of key features that were vital to our users to include for the MVP
                        product launch.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Embody on the go</h2>
                <p>
                    Another key finding from the study was that users wanted to be able to see where they were in their
                    cycle quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I designed an Embody widget so that users could see from their phone's home screen when their next
                    period date will be, what phase of their cycle they're in, and what day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We heard positive feedback that users really appreciated the convenience of the Embody widget, and
                    it set us apart from other period tracking apps on the market who didn't offer a widget experience.
                </p>

                    <h2>Post MVP launch</h2>
                    <p>For any new features, I first mapped out the user flow to understand the full user journey.</p>
                    <p>
                        I created wireframes and Figma prototypes so we could test early. Embody's symptom logging
                        feature was key to the app experience, so I prioritized this feature for early user testing. I
                        discovered several issues and made improvements to the design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also built a design system in Figma to better collaborate with the lead engineer and document
                        design decisions. The design system allowed me to scale and maintain consistency as we added new
                        features and new team members.

                        In addition to our social presences on TikTok and Instagram, I considered many entry points in
                        the user journey for how someone would hear about Embody.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important first impression was the Embody website. In a sea of generic stock photos, we
                        wanted Embody to show its authenticity. I directed a photo shoot to capture shots of Embody
                        users using our app in real-world scenarios.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We used the photography and the user feedback we gathered during the photo shoot across our
                        socials, pitch decks, app store listings, and the website.
