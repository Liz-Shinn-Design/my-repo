	I worked closely with the Mezo marketing and product teams to develop a branded visuals system they could use to meet their content strategy goals of transparency and user friendliness.</p>

	<h3>My Approach</h3>
	<p>My design goals for the project were to build a reusable, easy-to-understand template system in Figma that the marketing team could use themselves, and a design resource would initially be needed for review only. This would prevent a bottleneck and allow both the design team and the marketing team to meet their goals. I referenced Pinterest, infographics books, and the client brand deck to ensure the charts would align well with the Mezo brand.</p>
	<p>The visuals would be used both on the Mezo blog and in product documentation on GitBook. I worked closely with a member of the marketing team so I could uncover where the pain points were so we could systematize design work.</p>

	<h3>The Results</h3>
	<p>Initially, we frequently checked in to get feedback and improve the system. As I built more infographic templates and incorporated more varieties of data sets, it continued to expand in flexibility.
